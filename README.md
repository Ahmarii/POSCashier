# POSCashier

POSCashier is a **desktop Point-of-Sale (POS) system** written in Go, designed for seamless integration with both **hardware devices** and **web services**. The project includes a custom UI built with the Corgent Core GUI library, integration with an **RFID reader** using TinyGo, and a **WebSocket-based barcode scanner** interface.

## üîß Features

- üñ•Ô∏è **Desktop App** with modular design (Logic, Data, UI)
- üì° **WebSocket Integration** for external device communication (e.g., barcode scanner)
- üì∂ **RFID Support** using Raspberry Pi Pico and MFRC522 module
- üîÑ Real-time cart management and UI updates
- üßæ Order processing and PDF invoice generation
- üìÅ Clean code structure for easy development and scaling

---

## üß† Architecture Overview

- `Logic/` ‚Äì Core application logic and state management  
- `Data/` ‚Äì Handles API calls and data fetching from web server  
- `UI/` ‚Äì Frontend components using Corgent Core UI  

The app separates concerns into **Logic**, **Data**, and **UI**, allowing clean interaction between systems and maintainability.

## üì¶ Hardware Integration

### RFID Reader
- Uses **Raspberry Pi Pico**
- Programmed with **TinyGo**
- Communicates with MFRC522 RFID module
- Sends UID to the desktop app via serial

Custom RFID library:

### External WebSocket Barcode Scanner
- Barcode data is sent to the desktop app using the WebSocket protocol
- Handled by an internal WebSocket service in the app

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Requirements

- Go 1.20+
- TinyGo (for compiling firmware to Raspberry Pi Pico)
- Corgent Core GUI library
- A web server backend with API endpoints for:
  - Fetching products
  - Fetching customer by UID
  - Submitting orders

### Run Desktop App

```bash
go run main.go
```

### Flash RFID Reader Firmware

```bash
tinygo flash -target=pico main.go
```

## üì∏ UI Overview

- **ServiceStatus** ‚Äì Shows backend, hardware, and WebSocket status
- **ItemsDisplay** ‚Äì Grid of products fetched from server
- **ItemsAction** ‚Äì Add items by ID, refresh or sort catalog
- **CustomerDisplay** ‚Äì Shows customer info via RFID
- **CartsDisplay** ‚Äì Dynamic cart view with quantity adjustment
- **CartsInformation** ‚Äì Summary of cart totals, tax, and discounts
- **CartsAction** ‚Äì Finalize order and send to backend
